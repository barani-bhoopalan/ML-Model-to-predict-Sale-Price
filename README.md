# ML-Model-to-predict-Sale-Price
Our project is based on the Kaggle Housing Prices Competition

The following steps were followed to access the predictive model using regression algorithm.
-> Get Data
-> Clean, Prepare & Manipulate Data
-> Train Model
-> Test Data
-> Improve

Thanks to educative course, which helped me streamline my understanding towards step-wise split;

The following are the step-wise split of task 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis #
Understand the data structure
Discover and visualize the data to gain insights
Explore numerical attributes
Look for correlations among numerical attributes
Explore categorical attributes
2. Prepare the data for machine learning algorithms #
Deal with missing values
Handle outliers
Deal with correlated attributes
Handle text and categorical attributes
Feature scaling
3. Transformation Pipelines in Scikit-Learn #
4. Assess Machine Learning Algorithms #
Train and evaluate multiple models on the training set
Comparative analysis of the models and their errors
Evaluation Using Cross-Validation
5. Fine-Tune Your Model #
6. Present the Solution #
7. Launch, Monitor, and Maintain the System #
